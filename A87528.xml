            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <item>1. A Perpetuall Parliament is repugnant to the Act made this Parliament for a Trienniall Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for how can every three years a Paliament begin, if this be perpetuall, which may be ≈øo if the two Hou≈øes plea≈øe?</item>
               <item>2. An adjournment of the Parliament makes no Se≈ø≈øion, 4 <hi>Pars, In≈øtitut. fol.</hi> 27. Howbeit, before the Adjourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the King gives His Royall a≈ø≈øent to ≈øome Bills. <hi>Cooke, ibid.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. There is no Se≈ø≈øion till a prorogation or di≈ø≈øolution of the Parliament.</item>
               <item>4. This Parliament, as appeares by the Act for not di≈ø≈øol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>virg thereof, ≈øet downe in the Printed Statutes of this Parliament, <hi>fol.</hi> 138. cannot be prorogued but by Act of Parliament. There hath beene as yet no Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment pre≈øent, and therefore all the Acts of this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are Acts of one Se≈ø≈øion.</item>

<note place="margin">Plowd com. 79 35 H. 8. Bro. relation 35. Bro. Parl. 86. Dier. 1 Mariae 45.</note> and all the Acts of ≈øuch a Parliament are Acts of one day; ≈øo the Act for the Trienniall, and the Act for this Perpetuall, are two Acts of one day by the Law.</item>

A Parliament is to bee holden once every yeere, and more often if need ≈øhall bee; tho≈øe Acts are confirmed by the Act for the Trienniall Parliament. How doth a perpetuall Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment agree with a Parliament once every yeere, or with the intention of tho≈øe Lawes? How doth a Parliament every three yeers agree with a Parliament for ever, which may be, if the two Hou≈øes plea≈øe?</item>
               <item>7. The re≈øult is this; at one day in Law this Parliament two Acts have pa≈ø≈øed (for howbeit the one was in 16 <hi>Carol.</hi> and the other in 17. <hi>Carol.</hi> yet both in Law are Acts of one day) the one ≈øaith there ≈øhall be a Trienniall Parliament after the end of the ≈øitting of this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: The other, this Parliament ≈øhall ≈øit for ever, if they plea≈øe. The one will have a Parliament with an end, the other, a Parliament without an end.</item>

            <p>For Common Rea≈øon.
